# DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHMS  (PYTHON)

## Algorithm : 
It is a combination of sequence of finite steps to solve any particular problem.


### Properties of algo
* Terminate after finite amount of time 
* Produce atleast one output
* Independent of any programming language
* Unambigous (deterministic)

### Steps to construct the algorithm
* Problem definition
* design algorithm
* Drawa flowchart
* Testing
* Implementation
* Analysis

## Analysis :

### Type of analysis

* **Apostiary Analysis :** 
    * Dependent on type of hardware and language of compiler 
    * Exact answers
    * Similar answers
<br>
* **Apriori Analysis :**
    * Independent of type of hardware and language of compiler
    * Approximate answers
    * Similar answers

### Asymptotic Notation:
1. Worst case **Big O**
2. Best case senario **Omega**
3. Average case senario **Theta**
